## Introduction to Using APIs with Python

An application programming interface (API) is a tool that allows computers to communicate and share information. For social scientists, APIs can be useful for accessing data or services from firms, organizations, or government agencies. This workshop will introduce the use of APIs to obtain data from sources such as Survey Monkey, Twitter, or Data.gov. This workshop is intended for social scientists who are new to working with APIs, but have some familiarity with Python or have attended the Introduction to Python workshop.
